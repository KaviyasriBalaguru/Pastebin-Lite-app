# Pastebin-Lite-app
Pastebin-Lite is a simple full-stack web app that lets users create and share text pastes using a unique URL. Each paste can optionally expire by time or view count. The app provides REST APIs, safe HTML rendering, deterministic testing support, and uses persistent storage for serverless deployment.
